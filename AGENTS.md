## Accomplishments (session 2026-06-19)

**Morning session:**
- **Implemented `in`/`not_in` operators**: Rewrote `ir_gen_in_expression` with clean LLVM control flow (entry → loop → body → incr → found/notfound → merge with phi). Fixed GEP issue with slice structs by switching from GEP to Load+ExtractValue approach. Both arrays and slices work as RHS containers. Tests cover found/not-found for arrays and slices in both `if` conditions and assignments.
- **All 38 tests pass** (test_in.odin added with 11 subtests).

**Afternoon session:**
- **Implemented for-range loop codegen (`for i in expr { body }`)**: Discovered that grammar rules without `@AST_ACTION` annotations flatten their children into the parent (confirmed in `easy_pc_ast.c:341-360`). For `for i in 0..10 { body }`, the `ForStatement` handler receives `[Identifier("i"), Expression(range), CompoundStatement(body)]`. The semantic analyser detects for-range (first child is raw `AST_NODE_IDENTIFIER`, range expression resolves to `TD_KIND_RANGE`), then declares the loop variable as `i64` in the loop scope. The IR generator emits: entry (eval range, extract low/high from struct via alloca+GEP+load) → init loop var → cond (cmp < high) → body → inc (loop var++) → cond. Continue target is the increment block; break target is the end block. Tests cover both half-open (`0..<10`) and inclusive (`1..5`) ranges. **All 39 tests pass**.
